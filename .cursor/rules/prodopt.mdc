# Description
ProdOpt es un proyecto de hackathon, cuyo track tiene la siguiente descripci√≥n:

Create a system in Python that automates the necessary calculations to balance production with demand, allowing more precise and efficient planning and reducing costs, using linear programming modeling.Situation: Production is limited and is performed in cycles, therefore the bytes / bites need to be allocated to the products creating shortages and excess according to the demand and supply Variables: Yielded Supply, On Hand (Finished Goods) , Safety Stock Target (WOS) , Sellable Supply , Effective Demand, Total Projected Inventory Balance , Inventory Balance in excess of SST , Seedstock , R&O = Result Total Inventory Balance per period

The expected solution involves developing and sharing the code for automation, along with the final files, documentation, bibliography, and all related information necessary to explain the solution comprehensively.
